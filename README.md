## Overview
The **AI-Powered Health Assistant** is a chatbot designed to provide accurate and context-aware responses to medical queries using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning**. It leverages **SBERT for semantic search**, **ClinicalBERT for response refinement**, and **RapidFuzz for fuzzy matching**, ensuring precise answers to health-related questions. The chatbot also includes **text-to-speech (TTS)** functionality for enhanced accessibility.

## Features
✅ **Real-time Medical Query Processing** using advanced NLP models  
✅ **Context-Aware Answers** powered by ClinicalBERT  
✅ **Fuzzy Matching** to handle spelling variations  
✅ **Voice-Enabled Responses** with gTTS  
✅ **User-Friendly Web Interface** built with Streamlit  
✅ **GPU Acceleration** for faster response times
